## Introduction
The initial problem posed by CarMax for this analytics showcase was to uncover what features were driving CarMax customers' purchases. 

I will use Python programming and dashboarding to explore, model, and cleanly present findings from this data.

## Data
The provided data contained 132,717 observations and 31 variables. It contained two sets of feature variables. One for describing cars customers brought in for appraisal and another of the same type for the car that customer eventually purchased. It also contained some information about the transaction (whether it occurred online or in-person, what state it was in, etc.). 


## EDA
For my inital exploration of the data, I used a simple python file (`eda/raw-eda.py`). In this file I iteratively write code to explore and clean the data using a side-by-side interactive jupyter notebook session. This allows me to adjust my data while not having to worry about code blocks or markdown cells. The purpose of this file is to do a messier exploration of the entire data, identify areas of interest, and clean up any discrepencies in the data. Then, using sections of the code from this file, I will make focused notebooks that convey a narrative and can be presented to CarMax.
